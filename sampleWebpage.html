    <h1>Plank</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Targets:</b> Abdominals and core muscles
        </p>
        <p>The plank is one of the simplest exercises that you can do – it’s simple in its appearance and the amount of steps involved in doing one.</p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Strengthen Core</li>
            <li>Improve Posture</li>
            <li>Relieve Backpain</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>How to do a Plank</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure your elbows are directly under your shoulders</li>
            <li>Line your wrists up with your elbows</li>
            <li>Push your body upwards, and keep your chin tight to your neck</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The recommended time for beginners is 30 seconds, but if you can’t do that, you can consider anything less to be good practice – or switch to a forearm plank, where you rest your weight on your forearms instead of your palms, allowing you to hold the position for much longer.</p>
